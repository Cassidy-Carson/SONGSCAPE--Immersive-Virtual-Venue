# SONGSCAPE-Immersive Virtual Venue
2021 Creative Computation Capstone

# Project Outline
SONGSCAPE - Immersive Virtual Venue is a capstone-level project for the completion of the BA in Creative Computation. Digital concerts are an opportunity for artists to create their own digital universe and bring their fans right into their own mindset. Allowing for a strong digital intimacy and new personalized events – a true way for music to re-invent fandom creation and generate positive sentiment towards the artists, this virtual venue curates a dyanmic environment that adapts to any song.
