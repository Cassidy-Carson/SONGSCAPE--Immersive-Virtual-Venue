2021 Creative Computation Capstone

# About Cassidy
Cassidy Carson is a digital artist and creative synthesist exploring the intersection of technology and interactive design. Her projects incorporate themes of how technophila and new media may provide poignant, immersive experiences, and as a Columbia Records’ intern, music often inspires her work.

# Project Outline
SONGSCAPE - Immersive Virtual Venue is a capstone-level project for the completion of the BA in Creative Computation. Digital concerts are an opportunity for artists to create their own digital universe and bring their fans right into their own mindset. Allowing for a strong digital intimacy and new personalized events – a true way for music to re-invent fandom creation and generate positive sentiment towards the artists, this virtual venue curates a dyanmic environment that adapts to any song.

# Specs:
Cassidy used Unreal Engine 4 to create an immersive virtual concert venue, named SONGSCAPE. SONGSCAPE is a dynamic virtual space in which the environment changes according to the aesthetics of artists and their songs. During the design phase, Cassidy drew inspiration from famous amphitheaters within the US, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the Gorge Amphitheatre, and used Autodesk Maya to create a 3D stage. In the development phase, Cassidy visually scripted a multitude of blueprints, including a first-person pawn, two different sets of audio reactive particle systems, dynamic materials, as well as media players and animations. Cassidy then created a cinematic sequence to depict the three song piece experience within SONGSCAPE.
